# 클래스 변화
In case you are using HATEOAS v1.0 and above (Spring boot >= 2.2.0), do note that the classnames have changed. Notably the below classes have been renamed:

ResourceSupport changed to RepresentationModel
Resource changed to EntityModel
Resources changed to CollectionModel
PagedResources changed to PagedModel
ResourceAssembler changed to RepresentationModelAssembler
More information available in the official documentation here.

When using Spring boot starter, the below dependency would suffice to include HATEOAS:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>
Hoping this information will help someone like me who searched for hours to find why Resource class was not getting resolved.
